                    <p class="titles-content border-top pt-3">Teeth extraction, or tooth removal, addresses issues like decay,
                        infection, crowding, or trauma. Dentists numb the area and gently remove the tooth. Surgical
                        extraction may be needed for complex roots or impacted teeth.</p>
                    <p class="titles-content pt-2">After extraction, proper care prevents complications like dry
                        socket. Rest, pain management, and diet adjustments aid recovery. Tooth extraction is vital for
                        oral health. Consult a dentist for personalized care.</p>
