                        lightens or
                        removes black spots caused by melanin, often from medications or smoking. Techniques like
                        surgical or LASER ablation target melanocytes, reducing melanin production, resulting in
                        lighter, more uniform gums.</p>

                        and
                        cover of gums. Gums can affect smile: either by having more bulk or not having enough. Exposed
                        tooth roots or a gummy smile can contribute to a poor smile appearance. Treatments for adjusting
                        the height of the gums are performed in Aligning Beauty Dental Care.</p>

                    <p class="titles-content border-top pt-3">Patient's with gummy smile, where too much gum tissue can

                        teeth appear small or uneven by hiding the visible portion of the tooth have poor smile. A gummy
                        smile can affect an individual's appearance. Crown lengthening is done to remove the excess gum
                        bulk and to achieve a well-balanced smile.</p>

                        hygiene maintenance or other oral health factors, exposing the roots and may cause darkness
                        below the crown sometimes. Such gum recessions are tackled with methods of gum lengthening.</p>
