                    <p class="titles-content border-top pt-3 pb-3">A dental crown serves as a permanent covering for damaged or
                        fractured teeth, restoring their function and appearance. On the other hand, a dental bridge is
                        a prosthetic device used to fill the gap left by a missing tooth, enhancing oral function and
                        aesthetics.</p>
                    <p class="subline mb-1 mt-2">Why Bridges Are Needed</p>
                    <p class="titles-content">Bridges are essential to prevent the shifting of teeth, which can lead to bite
                        (occlusion) and jaw-related issues. By maintaining the integrity of existing teeth, bridges
                        contribute to a healthy and vibrant smile.</p>

                        <dt>Preparation</dt>
                        <dd>The tooth is numbed, decay is removed, and if necessary, root canal treatment is performed.
                            The tooth is then reshaped to ensure a perfect fit for the crown.</dd>

                        <dt>Crown Fabrication</dt>
                        <dd>Impressions of the teeth are taken to create a custom-made crown, which typically takes 3 to
                            4 days. During this period, a temporary acrylic crown is placed to protect the tooth.</dd>

                        <dt>Application</dt>
                        <dd>Once the permanent crown is ready, it is applied to the tooth, checked for fit, occlusion,
                            and shade, and then permanently cemented in place by the dentist.</dd>
