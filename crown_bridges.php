                    <p class="content border-top pt-3">A dental crown serves as a permanent covering for damaged or
                        fractured teeth, restoring their function and appearance. On the other hand, a dental bridge is
                        a prosthetic device used to fill the gap left by a missing tooth, enhancing oral function and
                        aesthetics.</p>
                    <p class="subline mb-1">Treatment Plan for Dental Crown</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Preparation</strong<br>The tooth is numbed, decay is removed, and if necessary, root
                                canal treatment is performed. The tooth is then reshaped to ensure a perfect fit for the
                                crown.</li>
                        <li><strong>Crown Fabrication</strong><br>Impressions of the teeth are taken to create a
                            custom-made crown, which typically takes 3 to 4 days. During this period, a temporary
                            acrylic crown is placed to protect the tooth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Application</strong><br>Once the permanent crown is ready, it is applied to the
                            tooth, checked for fit, occlusion, and shade, and then permanently cemented in place by the
                            dentist.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="subline mb-1">Why Bridges Are Needed</p>
                    <p class="content">Bridges are essential to prevent the shifting of teeth, which can lead to bite
                        (occlusion) and jaw-related issues. By maintaining the integrity of existing teeth, bridges
                        contribute to a healthy and vibrant smile.</p>
