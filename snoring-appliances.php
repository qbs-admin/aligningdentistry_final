                    <p class="titles-content border-top pt-3">Snoring appliances, like MADs and TRDs, are dental devices that
                        combat snoring. MADs advance the lower jaw to keep the airway open, while TRDs hold the tongue
                        forward to prevent airway blockage.</p>
                    <p class="titles-content pt-2">Custom-made by dentists, these appliances effectively treat
                        snoring and mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. Consulting a healthcare professional
                        ensures the right fit for individual needs.</p>
