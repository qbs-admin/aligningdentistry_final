                        diagnosis, and
                        specialized treatment for children's oral health. Regular check-ups monitor tooth development
                        and detect decay early. Pediatric dentists educate parents and kids on oral hygiene practices,
                        while treatments like cleanings, fluoride, sealants, and fillings are tailored for young
                        patients. Positive experiences during dental visits foster lifelong oral health habits, ensuring
                        children maintain healthy smiles as they grow.</p>
