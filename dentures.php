                    <p class="subline mb-1">Dentures are artificial teeth fitted onto a framework that allow a person to
                        speak, and chew food naturally, which otherwise is not possible because of missing teeth.</p>

                    <p class="subline mt-3 mb-1">Full Denture</p>
                    <p class="content border-top pt-3">Bone and tissue-supported dentures rely on the gums and
                        underlying bone, while implant-supported dentures are anchored to dental implants for increased
                        stability and support.</p>

                    <p class="subline mt-3 mb-1">Partial Denture</p>
                    <p class="content border-top pt-3">Partial dentures replace one or more missing teeth. Support is
                        obtained from adjacent teeth with help of metal extensions (clasps). Material used for
                        fabrication is acrylic.</p>
